Title:Large input number error

Severity/Priority: High/Low

Version: 1.00

Description:There is no API response when a decimal number is entered. There is no status code returned. This is inconsistent. When a negative number or no number is entered, there is s status code of 500 returned. When a correct input is entered a 200 status code is returned. There is no return code when a decimal is entered. There should be a error return code returned as well.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Go to http://localhost:6464/factorial
2.Enter a decimal such as 10.1
3.Submit the form
4.Take note of the result

Expected result: The application should return an error status code

Actual result: The application does not return any status code
