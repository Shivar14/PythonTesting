Title:Number input validation is inconsistent

Severity/Priority: High/Low

Version: 1.00


Description:There is an inconsistency when entering incorrect numbers in the form.Between no  number entered and
            entering a negative number. The server returns a response with 500 status code and a message of
            'internal server error' when there is no input. When entering a negative number it this different,
            the server returns a response with a 200 statu code and a message comes up as 'We don't have enough
            information to calculate the factorial.A confusion could occur to users due to this inconsistency.
            It would be ideal to have a more consistent validation way.

Steps to reproduce:
                    1. Go to http://localhost:6464/factorial
                    2.Submit the form without entering any number
                    3.Take note of the response
                    4.Enter a negative number (-14)
                    5.Take note of the response

Expected result: The server should return a consistent response for all input cases.

Actual result: The server returns an inconsistent response for inputs
